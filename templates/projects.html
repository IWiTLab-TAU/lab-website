    <p style="line-height: 1.7;">This project explores how people interact with decision support systems (DSS) that provide information similar to, or different from, what they already know. Across three experiments, we studied when users choose to pay for DSS help, how redundant information affects their performance, and how it shapes their trust in the system.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7;">We found that people were more likely to seek help from systems that offered new, non-redundant insights. Receiving information that simply confirmed what they already believed sometimes led to lower performance, and trust in the system varied depending on how useful its input was.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7;">These findings suggest that when designing decision aids, it's not enough for a system to be accurate, it also needs to add value beyond what the user already knows. Helping users recognize that value is key to building trust and ensuring effective use.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7;"><strong>Key insight:</strong> People are more likely to use decision support when it offers new information rather than simply confirming what they already believe. Redundant support can reduce performance and trust. For decision aids to be effective, they must not only be accurate but also provide unique information.</p>
